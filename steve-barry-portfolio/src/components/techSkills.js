            <p className='aboutP'>A creative problem solver and experienced developer, completing a certificate in Full Stack Web Development through. Having spent over a decade working in the technical areas of insurance, an opportunity arose to switch to something I had long held a passion and interest for: coding. Whilst living in Brasil, I studied web development through TAFE distance learning. Upon returning to Australia, I completed further courses, culminating in two TAFE diplomas, Software Development, and Web Development.</p>
            <p className='aboutP'>After volunteering with the Black Dog Institute, rebuilding and delivering their intranet, and building apps for small businesses, I spent a number of years working with the FileMaker platform. Although an accomplished developer with this, I decided to leave and re-hone my skills in web development, with the University of Sydney Full Stack Bootcamp.</p>
            <p className='aboutP'>I am seeking new challenges and opportunities, and with the skills gained through my lived and work experience, I believe I can be a valuable addition to any organisation.</p>
