            <p className='aboutP'>Hello there! Here's a little about me... I'm an avid Star Wars fan, I enjoy gaming, Lego, collecting wine (the centrepiece of my collection being a 2008 Penfold's Grange, and I also have wines from the 70s, 80s, 90s, as well as the 21st century), 
                singing terribly in the car to an eclectic range of music, and playing any games my three year old has thought up!</p>
            <p className='aboutP'>I today acknowledge the <a id="ackLink" href="https://www.darkinjung.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkinjung</a> people Traditional Custodians of the land on which I live today, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present. 
            I extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
